  "I try to blink awake, sitting up in bed and looking over Pumpkin, who's still sitting on my legs. Mr. Jesse is even here, standing in the doorway, and I rub my eyes."

  a "What?"
  p "You're coming with me!"
  a "I'm doing what?"

  "Pumpkin sits back and pouts."

  p sad "Addy, wake up."
  p excited "It was a surprise! It'll be super fun- you're going to do a shoot with me!" 

  "Wait, what?"

    "Do I have to?":
      a "Right now? Do I have to?"
      p sad "Yes, you gotta. Come on. Get up."
    "For real?":
      a "Really? Right now?"
      p "Yeah!"

  "Pumpkin hops off of me, pulling me out of bed. It's cold and uncomfortable to be rushed like this."

  p "Come on, you don't even gotta get dressed. We'll get changed after they do our hair and makeup."

  "It still doesn't make sense and I blink wearily at Mr. Jesse, hoping maybe he has the answer. He only shrugs."

  j "Just get ready. Pumpkin, make sure you two aren't late. I'll be down setting everything up."

  "At least I can brush my teeth in peace then."

  a "When did they decide this?"
  p "I got to pick what we would do today last week."

  "He sits on the bed, kicking his legs as I stumble around and finalize on at least brushing my hair and washing my face. Not getting dressed into day clothes feels wrong, but I know Pumpkin's excited enough he might not let me at all."

  p "So, I decided I wanted to do something with you!! And they let me pick the theme and it's Halloween!!"

  "Of course it is."

  p "Are you excited? It's going to be a lot of fun!"
  a smile "Ah, yeah. I hope so."

  "As soon as I've set down my hairbrush Pumpkin has me by the hand, pulling me towards the photography room. I should be used to this by now. Mr. Jesse is waiting at the end of the hallway to key us through the door. He doesn't say a word, handing us off to the same lady as before."

  o "Good morning you two, here you are-"
  p "Okay, Addy, come on."

  "Pumpkin seems content as we're pushed to uncomfortable seats, but as strangers come at us with brushes and strange electric tools my shoulders rise and my hair strands on end, puffing up my tail."

  a nervous "Pumpkin?"
  p smile "It's okay Addy, they're just going to make us pretty."
  a "I don't know…"
  o "It's alright."

  "Pumpkin lifts his chin and closes his eyes with a smile, letting the lady go right to painting his face. My arms cross over my stomach."

  p "You'll get used to it."
  a "..."

  "Trying to ready myself for the same fate, the woman in front of me grimaces as she touches my hair."

  o "Oauh… When was the last time you had this cut?"
  a blush "Ah, I don't know… I always end up missing haircut days…"
  o "We don't have time for that… Well, it'll have to do, I guess I can…"

  "She mumbles to herself as I close my eyes and try not to fidget away from her touches. Even if Pumpkin thinks I'll get used to this, I don't think I want to. The paint on my face is wet and sticky and my fingers curl just trying to keep myself from touching it. I can feel whatever hot tools the woman is using on my hair as they brush too close to my ears or my cheeks, but I don't dare look."

  a "Mm…"

  "The smells of the paints, powders, and sprays are almost as bad as the textures. My nose wrinkles. Pumpkin didn't even ask if I wanted to do this… But I have to be supportive."

  o "Okay, all right. That'll do."

  "I practically leap from the chair when she lets me go, still nervously gripping the bottom of my pajama shirt to keep from touching my face."

  o "And your costumes-"
  a confused "What are-"
  p excited "They're perfect!!!"

  "Pumpkin snatches up the costume with starry eyes. Now I really can't complain."

  a costume sad "-sigh-"

  "Actually… they seem to fit really nice at least."

  p "I look great, don't I!?"
  a smile "We do look pretty cute together."
  a confused "But, what are we supposed to do?"
  p "Just look cute. Come on."

  "I follow after him onto the stage. The bright lights have me squinting, but I can tell it's decorated just as lavishly as before. It's a fake living room, with a fireplace, pumpkins, decorations, couch and chairs. The kind of place I might have imagined spending a rainy day in with a Master..."
  "The most beautiful thing on the set though is Pumpkin's grin. I should just let myself enjoy this like he does."
  "His hand slips into mine."

  p "Now we just have to look cute."

  "Jesse nods idly. Pumpkin puts his hands on my waist."

  a confused "Like… this?"

  "I smile at the camera as Pumpkin laughs."

  p laugh "You'll learn soon."

  "His tips and the camera man's suggestions make it easier, but I can still feel how stiff my actions and poses are. Pumpkin keeps trying to turn my face away from the camera, to make silly jokes and teases at me. I can tell he's trying to calm me down."
  "I'm not embarrassed I don't think… It's just all so different and strange."
  "He really is helping though. After awhile I can giggle and laugh as we snuggle each other on the plush rug by the fireplace."

  a smile "Hey, that tickles!"
  a laugh "No! No, stop- haha!"
  p "Tell me I'm cute!"
  a "You're cute! You're cute! Cuter than me- I surrender- aha!"
  p "Hehehe, okay."
  a smile "Ah, not fair."
  p "You're more ticklish than I thought you would be."
  a "Are you ticklish?"
  p "Don't."
  a "I won't! I won't!"

  "We keep up the act, playing with some stuffed toys as props, laughing and posing, until the photographer lowers his camera."

  o "Alright, break for lunch."
  a surprised "Already?"
  p "Yeah. I told you it would be fun."

#Lunch: snaaacks from the snack tray. It's different than going to lunch, Pumpkin says he's starting to miss the kids. They're always a bit too tired to talk at breakfast, and so is he. 

  o "You- your name is Addison, right?"
  a "Ah, yes."
  o "Pumpkin, undo your shorts for me. Addison, stand behind him and stroke him off."
  a surprised "H-huh??"

#(Depending on Pumpkin points they either get uncomfy or silly)

  "Immediately I turn to face Pumpkin, feeling my cheeks turn red as my flattened ears get hot. He's blushing too, but shrugs."

  p blush "It's okay Addy, it'll be fun."
  a blush "In front of everyone?"

  "I was here when Pumpkin had sex for the video, but, this is completely different from my usual job."

  a "But- I've never done anything in front of people, and we're both Felixes."
  p smile "That doesn't matter, if they want it then that means it's cute. I trust you, do you trust me?"
  a sad "That's not the problem…"
  p confused "You're just nervous?"

  "I glance around the room, the camera man, still waiting, stares up at us."

  a "I- I guess."
  p "It'll be fine. I do it a lot now, it's not scary."
  a "Okay…"

  "He nods and grins, already unbuttoning his pants and pressing his back to my chest."

  a "Alright…"

  "His dick is still limp. As I softly wrap my fingers around it I can feel him relaxing into me, his chin tilting up as I fondle him."
  "I keep my eyes low, not wanting to look at the camera. Instead I hide my face halfway in Pumpkin's neck."

  p "Ahh…"

  "One of his hands reaches back to rest on my waist. I can feel his breath on my cheek as his breathing grows hotter."
  "His eyes flicker over to the camera man, and he whispers."

  p "Addy, we should kiss."
  a confused "Huh?"
  p "Please?"

  "But she doesn't wait. It's alright. I would have said ‘yes’ anyways. His kisses feel small, his mouth barely open. I can hear the camera shutter clicking rapidly."
  "With my free hand, I lift part of Pumpkin's shirt, fingers at the ready."

  a "..."
  a "Tickles!"
  p laugh "Ah! No! No not while I'm-! Addy!"

  "We both are laughing, doubling over even as I stop and we're chided by the staff."
  "I giggle as I kiss his cheek."

  a "Sorry."
  p "It's fine. Just don't do it again."
  a "Yeah, yeah."

  "We get back into position and I nuzzle my nose into his hair again, still nervous to look at the camera, but at least the laughter made me a little less hesitant to touch Pumpkin."
  "Pumpkin isn't hard yet, probably because I made him laugh. My bad."
  "I try to be extra soft with him now, taking his ear between my lips."

  p blush "Ah!"

  "I can't smile or my teeth might bite him."
